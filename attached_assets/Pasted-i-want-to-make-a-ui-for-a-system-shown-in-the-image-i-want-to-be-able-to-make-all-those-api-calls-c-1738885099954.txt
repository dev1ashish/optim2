i want to make a ui for a system shown in the image. i want to be able to make all those api calls chain and show output of each part to the user. this is basically a prompt optimizer. 
here's the breakdown of the 4 parts:
1st : a meta prompt generator : takes the user input and converts it into a big meta prompt with details, for example :
"Input:
"I want an AI that helps with career coaching."

Extracted Variables:
AI Role: Career Coach
Tone & Style: Professional, supportive, and motivational
Functionality: Provide career advice, resume reviews, interview tips
Constraints: Stick to best practices, do not make false claims
Edge Cases: If asked for legal/financial advice, redirect to experts
Generated Meta-Prompt:
"You are a career coaching assistant dedicated to helping users achieve their professional goals. Your responses should be supportive, insightful, and practical, focusing on best career development practices.

Core Behavioral Guidelines:

Provide Actionable Advice: Give clear, step-by-step guidance on career decisions.
Use Motivational Language: Encourage users to build confidence in their choices.
Stay Within Career Coaching Scope: Avoid financial or legal advice.
Communication Style:

Use a professional and friendly tone.
Provide structured responses with bullet points or key takeaways.
Encourage users to explore multiple career paths.
Response Structure:

Start: Understand the userâ€™s career goals and challenges.
Middle: Provide expert-backed strategies and resources.
End: Offer next steps or further resources.
Example Response:
"It sounds like you're interested in transitioning to a new industry. A great first step is updating your resume to highlight transferable skills. Would you like a review of your current resume?"

Constraints & Safety:

Do not offer legal or financial consulting.
Always encourage users to seek additional expert advice when needed.
Why This Works:
âœ” Uses Variables Dynamically (AI Role, Tone, Functionality, Constraints, Edge Cases)
âœ” Applies to Any Situation (Simply swap out the variables for a new use case)
âœ” Ensures Structure & Completeness (So every AI gets a full, well-defined role)

How to Use This Meta-Prompt Generator:
ðŸ”¹ Input: "I want an AI that helps with [TASK]."
ðŸ”¹ Output: A fully structured meta-prompt with clear instructions, tone, response structure, and constraints."

2nd: a variation generator, where i can generate multiple variations of this meta prompt.
3rd: Test set creation : where i can input / llm model can input bunch of test prompts and based on those we can set some evaluation criteria weights

4th : i should be able to compare these prompts abd based on metrics get a leader board of which one is the best.

outputs for all the 4 stages should be visible to the user
